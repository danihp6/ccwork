# CCWork

## Introduction
The proposed architecture simulates a FaaS (Function as a Service) environment using a microservices-based approach. At the core of the solution is an API built with Express, which serves as the entry point for users to interact with the service. Through this API, users can manage their accounts, register their functions as images, and request the execution of those functions. To handle authentication and enhance security, the API is protected by a reverse proxy implemented with Apache APISIX. User and function data are centralized in a MongoDB database, ensuring reliable and scalable storage.

To handle execution requests, a NATS-based message queue is used to enqueue the requests generated by users. These requests are processed asynchronously by a group of distributed workers, designed to consume the requests from the queue and execute the functions as needed. This approach ensures high availability, scalability, and the ability to handle variable loads by distributing the processing across multiple workers. The combination of these components creates a modular and efficient environment that reflects the flexibility and key characteristics of a FaaS service.
